Here in this report we will be evaulating four Business Continiuty Plans for comapnies. We will examine the cause, results and lastly evaluate what these companies could of improve in recreating this Business Continity Plan. 
 <br>



<h2>Background</h2>
In my research I have found two interesting facts as it relates to Business Continuity plans. 
1. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) around  40% small to mid size businesses do not reopen after a natural disaster, and an additional 25% reopen but fail within a year.
2. According to Spiceworks study, 95 % of responders said they have Diaster Recovery Plan (Business Continuity Plan) in place but 23% have not tested this Plan out. 
The best way to learn something is to learn from other mistakes and below we will look at 3 corporations that made a mistake in there Busienss Continuty Plan and fix it. In order to fully appreciate the value of an effective business continuity plan, itâ€™s helpful to take a look at where real businesses went wrong. <br>

<br />

<h2>Failed Business Continuity Plans:</h2>
<h2>1. Delta Airlines</h2>
Organization Background: Delta Air Lines is one of the major airlines of the United States which operates over 5,400 flights daily and serves 325 destinations in 52 countries on six continents.<br> <br>
Cause: In 2016 Delta had a IT infrastructure outage, there backups were greatly delayed which is estimated to have cost Delta their repuation but also a revenue loss of 100 Million dollars. <br> <br>
Cost: $100 million in Revenue and hit to repuation.<br> <br>
Improvement: Delta should of mainly ensured they had a effective data recovery method in place that was responsive. they could tested the plan monthly to ensure the backups worked and that the backups executed in a satistory time. <br> <br>


<h2>2. State of California DMW (Department of Motor Vechiles) </h2>
Organization Background:The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is the state agency that issues driver licenses to the  U.S. state of California residents and also registers motor vehicles and boats.<br> <br>
Cause: Back in 2016 both the Calkifornia DMV's backup systems went offline aduring the same time. It was discovered that the systems went down simultaneously because they ran alongside each other rather than through separate power sources. As a result California residents could not vist the DMW for several days causing a hit to the California DMV's Repuation <br> <br>
Cost:Revenue and Repuation <br> <br>
Improvement: The California DMW should have tested the BCP to ensure that backup systems ran on diffrent power source at least every 6 months out of the year<br> <br>

<h2>3. Breazeale, Sachse & Wilson LLP</h2>
Organization Background: Breazeale, Sachse & Wilson LLP is considered one of the oldest law firms in the Louisiana having approximetly 70 employed attorneys.<br> <br>
Cause: All the way back in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina staff members were unable to  access  client information or business data was a result of the hurricane. This was they failed to have a backup stregtry in place and all information staff members needed to access was on site hard copies. The firm was forced to stop its mission critical servers and had no plan to excute that would be able to contact clients and assure them the firm was still operational. Forunastly, the firm did not become apart of the  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) static of 40% small to mid size businesses not reopening after a natural disaster and by luck remains a thrive business with backups and alternate communication strategies.<br> <br>
Cost: Repuation, Clients, Revenue  <br> <br>
Improvement: Breazeale, Sachse & Wilson LLP going forward to survive (which they did) would have to address serveral things. 
1. Having a Risk Assements <br> 
2. Identifying Priorties <br> 
3. Alternative Communication Strategies  <br> 
4. Backup Server (Different Site out of Louisana) <br> <br>
