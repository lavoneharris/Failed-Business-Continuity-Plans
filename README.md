<h1>Failed Business Continuity Plans </h1>
<h2>Description</h2>

Here in this report we will be evaulating four Business Continiuty Plans for comapnies. We will examine the cause, results and lastly evaluat what these companies could of improve in recreating this Business Continity Plan. 
 <br>



<h2>Background</h2>
In my research I have found two interesting facts as it relates to Business Continuity plans. 
1. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) around  40% small to mid size businesses do not reopen after a natural disaster, and an additional 25% reopen but fail within a year.
2. According to Spiceworks study, 95 % of responders said they have Diaster Recovery Plan (Business Continuity Plan) in place but 23% have not tested this Plan out. 
The best way to learn something is to learn from other mistakes and below we will look at 4 corporations that made a mistake in there Busienss Continuty Plan and fix it <br>

<br />

<h2>Business Continuity Plan (BCP) Process:</h2>
This tends to involve a 4 step process:<br />
<br /> 1. <strong>Analysis</strong> (Risk evaluation and determine business impact)<br /> 
 <br /> 2.<strong>Design</strong> (Develop recovery strategies) <br /> 
<br /> 3.<strong>Implement</strong> (Implement the solution)<br /> 
 <br />4.<strong>Test</strong> (Test your plan in different scenarios and ensure the plan is updated regularly)  <br /> 
<br />

<h2>Types Business Continuity</h2>
1.  <strong>Operational</strong>  - Are systems and processes that are mission critical able to function without disruption? (Outages with mission critical services, Issues in Supply Chain, and Product failures)<br><br>
2.  <strong>Technological</strong>  - Are the technologies that the organization relies can ensure the integrity of their system? (Data loss, Hardware failure, and telecom outages)<br><br>
3.  <strong>Economic</strong>  - Is the organization able to still be profitable during a  economic issue? (Recession and Financial loss)<br><br>
4.  <strong>Workforce</strong>  - Having enough staff, right staff, that can handle work in turmoil. (Workplace strikes, Loss of essential employee, not scaling the department)<br><br>
5.  <strong>Safety</strong>  - Having a safe work environment for employees. (Pandemics, Occupational hazards, Workplace emergencies)<br><br>
6.  <strong>Environmental</strong>  - Being able to operate efficiently and safely in work setting. (Severe weather and Natural hazards) <br><br>
7.  <strong>Security</strong>  - Making sure business assets are secure from breach that can effect operation, safety, and reputation. (Theft, Vandalism, and Cyberattacks)<br><br>
<br>
<h2>Difference between Business Continuity vs Disaster Recovery </h2>
While a Disaster Recovery Plans are apart of the large umbrella of a Business Continuity Plan, a Disaster Recovery Plan is a more technical plan used when recovering from a failure. A Business Continuity Plan is way figuring out the relationship during crisis.<br>
<strong>Examples of Recon Emails in the real world:</strong> <br>
 
 <br>
<strong> BCP:</strong>  <br>
1. Goal to keep organization operational during disaster.<br>
2. Goal to limit down time.<br>
 <br>
 <strong> Disaster Recovery:</strong>  <br>
1. Goal is restore data and access after a disaster.<br>

<h2>Kiwi Business Continiuty Plan </h2> 
 <h2>Purpose</h2> 
 A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is a process of system prevention and recovery from potential threats to organizations like our own at Kiwi. With a BCP the main goal is to ensure that personnel and assets are protected and are able to function during a disaster. <br>
 
 <h2>Scope</h2> 
 Kiwi, operates solely out of its only Headquarters in Brooklyn, New York with 50 % of employees working onsite and 50 % working via Work From Home (WFH ) model. While having a onsite model our organization is more easily affected by typical causes of business disruptions like natural disasters (Snow Storm, Flash Flooding, and Hurricanes), Workplace equipment failure, Terrorist Attacks, Global Pandemics and Telecommunications Outages. While our Work From Home (WFH) is not effected by these typical causes of business disruption we do still face challenges. Our BCP works in conjunction with the Disaster Recover Plan (DRP) we have created.<br>

</table>
 <h2>Procedure</h2>  
 <strong>BCP for Employees (WFH)</strong><br>
Kiwi is essentially 50/50 in terms of both being a remote company and an onsite organization. In terms of (WFH) plans are much more simpler as of vendors such as Google and Microsoft are bound to their Service Level Agreements as they host our data and services. As we further transition to a full WFH workforce an advantage will be if a Team within Kiwi become unavailable and cannot complete their work, Kiwi will still be available to operate. <br>

The exception being situations where there is a single point of failure. In example, the Lead engineer who has final say in triggering the BCP plan is unavailable due to tornado that wiped out all communication in the engineers area for several weeks). We would have to find an alternate way of getting in contact with this engineer or develop a new plan to have a second designated final approver when the first approver is unavailable.<br>
 
 <strong>BCP for Employees (Onsite)</strong><br>
Kiwi as stated before is essentially 50/50 in terms of both being  a remote company and a onsite organization. In terms of onsite plans its much more difficult as there is bevy of factors that can effect Business Continuity. Here below I will list some of the causes of business disruptions affecting Kiwi onsite employees and plans to counteract them. <br>
 
 <strong>Global Pandemics</strong><br>
This is relevantly recent as of 2020 global pandemic COVID-19 which affected all businesses across the world as they were unprepared in their Business Continuity Plans regarding a global pandemic. This was no different for us a Kiwi as we did not plan for a global pandemic and will make our best efforts to plan further ahead for situations that may arise in our ever expanding world. Currently we have taken the appropriate steps to come up with a Business Continuity Plan in the event of another global pandemic or global health emergency. The plan is  segment site availability for designated time slots for employees or allowing employees to work from home as they will be able to access data remotely. If it is required an employee must come to the office they must remain isolated arrive at their designated time slot, pass a health screening, wear a mask, and have the current medical records in terms of shots up to date by 1/1/23<br>
 
 
 <strong>Unplanned Telecommunication Outages</strong><br>
Business rely heavily on telecommunications working properly to be able to conduct business to most organizations this is consider a mission critical asset. At Kiwi telecommunication is mission critical, if we cannot communicate internally with our colleagues or with our customers it will result in an estimated financial loss of $250,000 for every hour telecommunications are down . In the event our telecommunications provider Spectrum has an outage that has a Meantime to Repair (MTR) over1 Hour until services are up and running. All employees will receive onsite their own personal hotspot to perform essential duties only until Spectrum resolves the issue. <br>

 
<strong>Serve Weather (Flooding or Snow)</strong> <br>
In the event of serve weather such as flooding or snow we urge all employees to use there best judgement before making the commute to the onsite office to ensure their safety. All Kiwi employees are allowed to work from home as long as they have their company laptops and an acceptable internet connection. In times of weather related state of emergencies Kiwi’s onsite office will be closed and will not reopen until the state of emergency is over and it is the next business day.  <br>
 
 <h2>Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</h2> 
 <strong> RTO</strong>  and <strong> RPO</strong>  are two parameters which are used in a Business Continuity plan. <br>
<strong> RTO</strong>  is the amount of time a service level or business process must be restored after a disaster.<br>
<strong> RPO</strong>  is the amount of time that has passed during a disruption before the amount of data lost has exceeded the Business Continuity Plan allowable threshold. <br>
 
 <h2>Triggers of a Business Continuity Plan </h2> 
 It is vital that a Business Continuity Plan is triggered at the appropriate time as it being too late or early can reduce its effect. <br>
<strong>There several points to consider when triggered:</strong><br>
<strong>Severity</strong> (Ex: Earthquake a mile away from the office would be considered a severity level 1)<br>
<strong>ETA:</strong> Estimated time of resolution is greater than a normal incident.<br>
<strong>Recovery:</strong>Recovery is uncertain and cannot be resolved in business defined recovery time <br>
<strong>Priority Levels</strong> <br>
<strong>P1</strong>- Outage with immediate impact to Kiwi customers. (Ex: Kiwi Cloud completely down)<br>
<strong>P2</strong> - Outage would have immediate impact on Kiwi to continue business. ( Ex: Malicious Software Attack)<br>
<strong>P3</strong> - Outage greater than 72 hours would have impact on Kiwi’s ability to conduct business.<br>
<strong>P4</strong> - Non critical System (I.e. Kiwi Notepad down).<br>

  <h1>Communication Plan and Role Assignments </h1> 
 In the event of disaster communication is vital, without communication our Business Continuity Plan will be an utter failure as Kiwi colleagues will not be on the same page. This is why documentation should be updated regularly with employees contact information. Team members should have an understanding of their role and have their assignments clearly laid out during a Business Continuity Plan which will also have actions that need to be taken via guidelines and procedures. <br>
  <h1>Verification of Business Continuity Plan from Senior management Steps:</h1> 
 <strong>Verification of Business Continuity Plan from Senior management Steps:</strong><br>
1. Kiwi documentation related to Business Continuity is reviewed and updated, then approved by Kiwi leadership. <br>
2. The plan is then labeled as a work in progress.<br>
3. Teams will verify that all details and covered and no outliers exist.<br>
4. Team members must confirm their most recent details like contact information annually. <br>
5. Manager will share the plan with team members based on role and department ensuring they know their role in the plan. <br> 
  <h2>Vendor Communication and Service Restoration Plan </h2> 
 A plan cannot be successful without restoring customer confidence. As a final step, we have ensured that there is a detailed vendor communication plan as part of the Business continuity preparation plan. This plan will check  all systems and services to ensure normal operations have resumed as intended once the damage is repaired in the area. This includes checking  with the main service providers on restoration and access.<br>
  <h2>Root Cause Analysis </h2> 
 With incidents there are bound to be mistakes or lessons learned. This is where root cause analysis comes into place, it will review the cause of the incident and develop ways that this incident any be avoided in future improving and eventually updating the Business Continuity Plan. For example you are growing tomatoes and then all of sudden the next day the tomatoes have been eating by dear. You would probably learn from this in make a fenced in garden for your tomato plants, what you did was preform a root cause analysis after your plan to grow tomatoes didn't materialize correctly in this case the cause is hungry animals.<br>
  <h2>Business Continuity Test </h2> 
 With any plan it is important to test it out to confirm that the plan works. This in turn allows you to figure out if the plan is effective, trains others on the plan , and identifies weak points on where the plan can be strengthen. Now let's take my tomatoes example from earlier say we test out making a fenced in garden and the next day the tomatoes are eaten again. You notice that there is burrowed hole near the fenced in garden. Again your test has failed so you may go back to the drawing board and create a vertical garden unreachable for hungry animals and test again. <br><br>
 <strong>Business Continuity Testing Importance</strong><br>
Confirm that your continuity objectives are met (RTO and RPO). <br>
Measure response to impactful events.<br>
Identify points in the plan that needed to be reevaluated and need modification and then improve them.<br><br>
<strong>Business Continuity Plan Testing Examples</strong><br>
<strong>Data Loss/Breach:</strong><br>
One of the most prevalent workplace disasters today, a data loss or breach could be due to any of the following:<br>
<strong>Ransomware and cyberattacks:</strong><br>
Unintentionally erased files or folders<br>
<strong>Server/drive crash</strong><br>
<strong>Data Center outage:</strong><br>

The main goal is to regain access to the company data as soon as possible as without access to this data it could lead to major financial loss by the minute. Normally, you would restore from a backup that is taken incrementally. Here there are several questions that have to come to mind.  Who does the backup? Priority? First person contacted? What vendors are needed if any? Financial loss? Lingering threats?<br>
 <h2>Emergency Communication </h2> 
 The Main goal is to be able to communicate in the event of a disaster or emergency. If that emergency or disaster is so devastating that there may be no common way of being in contact. It is important that alternate forms of communication be tested for ease, reliability, and efficiency. It is also vital that all team members in an organization update their contact information of regular basis (3 months) so timely information can be provided to them in the event of a disaster. <br>
