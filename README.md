<h1>Failed Business Continuity Plans </h1>
<h2>Description</h2>

Here in this report we will be evaluating three Business Continuity Plans of organizations and their failures. We will examine the organizations background, cause, cost and improvement these organizations could make when  recreating their Business Continuity Plan. 
 <br>



<h2>Background</h2>
In my research I have found two interesting facts as it relates to Business Continuity plans. <br><br>
1. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) around  40% small to mid size businesses do not reopen after a natural disaster, and an additional 25% reopen but fail within a year. <br><br>
2. According to a Spiceworks study, 95 % of responders said they have Disaster Recovery Plan (Business Continuity Plan) in place but 23% have not tested this Plan out. <br><br>
The best way to learn something is to learn from other mistakes and below we will look at 3 corporations that have made a mistake in their Business Continuity Plan and fix it. In order to fully appreciate the value of an effective business continuity plan, itâ€™s helpful to take a look at where real businesses went wrong. <br>

<br />

<h2>Failed Business Continuity Plans (BCP):</h2>
<h2>1. Delta Airlines</h2>
<strong> Organization Background:</strong>  Delta Air Lines is one of the major airlines of the United States which operates over 5,400 flights daily and serves 325 destinations in 52 countries on six continents.<br> <br>
<strong> Cause:</strong>  In 2016 Delta had a IT infrastructure outage, there backups were greatly delayed which is estimated to have cost Delta their reputation but also a revenue loss of 100 Million dollars. <br> <br>
<strong> Cost:</strong>  $100 million in Revenue and hit to reputation.<br> <br>
<strong> Improvement:</strong>  Delta should have mainly ensured they had an effective data recovery method in place that was responsive. They could tested the plan monthly to ensure the backups worked and that the backups executed in an acceptable time. <br> <br>


<h2>2. State of California DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) </h2>
<strong> Organization Background: </strong> The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is the state agency that issues driver licenses to the  U.S. state of California residents and also registers motor vehicles and boats.<br> <br>
<strong> Cause:</strong>  Back in 2016 both of California DMV's backup systems went offline during the same time. It was discovered that the systems went down simultaneously because they ran alongside each other, rather than through separate power sources. As a result California residents could not visit the DMW for several days causing a hit to the California DMV's Reputation <br> <br>
<strong> Cost: </strong> Revenue and Reputation <br> <br>
<strong> Improvement:</strong>  The California DMW should have tested the Business Continuity Plan (BCP) to ensure that backup systems ran on different power source at least every 6 months out of the year<br> <br>

<h2>3. Breazeale, Sachse & Wilson LLP</h2>
<strong> Organization Background:</strong>  Breazeale, Sachse & Wilson LLP is considered one of the oldest law firms in the Louisiana having approximately 70 employed attorneys.<br> <br>
<strong> Cause:</strong>  All the way back in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina staff members were unable to  access client information or business data was a result of the hurricane. This was because they failed to have a backup strategy in place and all THE information staff members needed to access were on site hard copies. The firm was forced to stop its mission critical servers and had no plan to execute that would be able to contact clients and assure them the firm was still operational. Fortunately, the firm did not become apart of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) statistic of 40% small to mid size businesses not reopening after a natural disaster and by luck remains a thriving business with backups and alternate communication strategies today.<br> <br>
<strong> Cost:</strong>  Reputation, Clients, and Revenue  <br> <br>
<strong> Improvement:</strong>  Breazeale, Sachse & Wilson LLP going forward to survive (which they did) would have to address several things. <br>
1. Having a Risk Assessments <br> 
2. Identifying Priorities <br> 
3. Alternative Communication Strategies  <br> 
4. Backup Server (Different Site out of Louisiana) <br> <br>
